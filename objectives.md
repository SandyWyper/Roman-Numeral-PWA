# Roman Numeral Converter PWA

### This is an excercise in creating a simple Progresive Web App

##### Objectives

* Provide the user with a very plain and simple interface
* App-like appearence in the browser
* Users should be able to use it off-lines
* It can be installed to the browser or home page
  (not sure how this works yet - we shall find out)


#### Some notes

Hosting will either be with gh-pages or Firebase. I am a complete novice at this,
so will possibly have to move the goal posts as we go.

A number of converters are available on-line, but none i can see are PWA's.
If it looks good, then might be worth puting it live with banner ads.....?
This sounds a bit far fetched, and could ruin the simplicity of it.
