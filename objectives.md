# Roman Numeral Converter PWA

### This is an exercise in creating a simple Progressive Web App

##### Objectives

* Provide the user with a very plain and simple interface
* App-like appearance in the browser
* Users should be able to use it off-line
* It can be installed to the browser or home page
  (not sure how this works yet - we shall find out)


#### Some notes

Hosting will either be with gh-pages or Firebase. I am a complete novice at this,
so will possibly have to move the goal posts as we go.
The simpler this thing is the better! Happy to do this collaboratively, if
anyone else wants to get involved it like to learn how to work together.
